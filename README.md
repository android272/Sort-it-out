### Sort it out

There are various way to sort data some are more efficient than others, this is simple project I used to help me understand **Big O Notation**. In this project I implemented Bubble Sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort, and finally Heapsort. Bellow is how well the different sorts do with various sets of data.

> As I develop the other algorithms and get my profiler working I will update this section to show how efficient each algorithm is.

### What I learned

- **Big O Notation**
- Test Driven Development **TDD**
- Version Control with **git**
- Recursion
- Naming matters
- control vs data variables
- How heaps and binary trees work.
